  Fetch YouTube video transcripts and transform them into structured content
  (chapters, summaries, threads, blog posts). Use when the user shares a YouTube
  URL or video link, asks to summarize a video, requests a transcript, or wants
  to extract and reformat content from any YouTube video.

# YouTube Content Tool

Extract transcripts from YouTube videos and convert them into useful formats.

## Setup

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

## Helper Script

`SKILL_DIR` is the directory containing this SKILL.md file. The script accepts any standard YouTube URL format, short links (youtu.be), shorts, embeds, live links, or a raw 11-character video ID.

```bash
# JSON output with metadata
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Plain text (good for piping into further processing)
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --text-only

# With timestamps
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --timestamps

# Specific language with fallback chain
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --language tr,en
```

## Output Formats

After fetching the transcript, format it based on what the user asks for:

- **Chapters**: Group by topic shifts, output timestamped chapter list
- **Summary**: Concise 5-10 sentence overview of the entire video
- **Chapter summaries**: Chapters with a short paragraph summary for each
- **Thread**: Twitter/X thread format — numbered posts, each under 280 chars
- **Blog post**: Full article with title, sections, and key takeaways
- **Quotes**: Notable quotes with timestamps

### Example — Chapters Output

```
00:00 Introduction — host opens with the problem statement
03:45 Background — prior work and why existing solutions fall short
12:20 Core method — walkthrough of the proposed approach
24:10 Results — benchmark comparisons and key takeaways
31:55 Q&A — audience questions on scalability and next steps
```

## Workflow

1. **Fetch** the transcript using the helper script with `--text-only --timestamps`.
2. **Validate**: confirm the output is non-empty and in the expected language. If empty, retry without `--language` to get any available transcript. If still empty, tell the user the video likely has transcripts disabled.
3. **Chunk if needed**: if the transcript exceeds ~50K characters, split into overlapping chunks (~40K with 2K overlap) and summarize each chunk before merging.
4. **Transform** into the requested output format. If the user did not specify a format, default to a summary.
5. **Verify**: re-read the transformed output to check for coherence, correct timestamps, and completeness before presenting.

## Error Handling

- **Transcript disabled**: try these fallbacks before telling the user:
  1. Extract visible metadata from the page: title, hashtags, channel name, uploader — use `browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot` to read the page.
  2. Take a screenshot with `browser_vision()` to visually inspect the video content (if vision model is available).
  3. Identify the core topic/concept from the title and hashtags.
  4. **Research the concept** using external sources (Wikipedia, Google/Bing/Baidu, academic databases). The video's title often hints at a scientific topic or phenomenon — search for it directly.
  5. If the concept is found (e.g., "树枝育金" → "Phytomining"), analyze its real-world viability using authoritative sources.
  6. Present findings grounded in evidence, distinguishing the video's claim from scientific reality.
- **Private/unavailable video**: relay the error and ask the user to verify the URL.
- **No matching language**: retry without `--language` to fetch any available transcript, then note the actual language to the user.
- **Dependency missing**: run `pip install youtube-transcript-api` and retry.
- **Search engines blocking (anti-bot)**: try different search engines (Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo lite mode via curl) or go directly to Wikipedia/arXiv/Google Scholar which are usually accessible.
