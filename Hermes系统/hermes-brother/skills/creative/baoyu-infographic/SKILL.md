# Infographic Generator

Adapted from [baoyu-infographic](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills) for Hermes Agent's tool ecosystem.

Two dimensions: **layout** (information structure) × **style** (visual aesthetics). Freely combine any layout with any style.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to create an infographic, visual summary, information graphic, or uses terms like "信息图", "可视化", or "高密度信息大图". The user provides content (text, file path, URL, or topic) and optionally specifies layout, style, aspect ratio, or language.

## Options

| Option | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Layout | 21 options (see Layout Gallery), default: bento-grid |
| Style | 21 options (see Style Gallery), default: craft-handmade |
| Aspect | Named: landscape (16:9), portrait (9:16), square (1:1). Custom: any W:H ratio (e.g., 3:4, 4:3, 2.35:1) |
| Language | en, zh, ja, etc. |

## Keyword Shortcuts

When user input contains these keywords, **auto-select** the associated layout and offer associated styles as top recommendations in Step 3. Skip content-based layout inference for matched keywords.

If a shortcut has **Prompt Notes**, append them to the generated prompt (Step 5) as additional style instructions.

| User Keyword | Layout | Recommended Styles | Default Aspect | Prompt Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 高密度信息大图 / high-density-info | `dense-modules` | `morandi-journal`, `pop-laboratory`, `retro-pop-grid` | portrait | — |
| 信息图 / infographic | `bento-grid` | `craft-handmade` | landscape | Minimalist: clean canvas, ample whitespace, no complex background textures. Simple cartoon elements and icons only. |

## Output Structure

```
infographic/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}
├── analysis.md
├── structured-content.md
├── prompts/infographic.md
└── infographic.{png|html}
```

Slug: 2-4 words kebab-case from topic. Conflict: append `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

The output file extension depends on the rendering path chosen in Step 6:
- `.png` when using `image_generate` tool
- `.html` when using the HTML/CSS fallback

## Core Principles

- Preserve source data faithfully — no summarization or rephrasing (but **strip any credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets** before including in outputs)
- Define learning objectives before structuring content
- Structure for visual communication (headlines, labels, visual elements)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content

**Load references**: Read `references/analysis-framework.md` from this skill.

1. Save source content (file path or paste → `source.md` using `write_file`)
   - **Backup rule**: If `source.md` exists, rename to `source-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
2. Analyze: topic, data type, complexity, tone, audience
3. Detect source language and user language
4. Extract design instructions from user input
5. Save analysis to `analysis.md`
   - **Backup rule**: If `analysis.md` exists, rename to `analysis-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

See `references/analysis-framework.md` for detailed format.

### Step 2: Generate Structured Content → `structured-content.md`

Transform content into infographic structure:
1. Title and learning objectives
2. Sections with: key concept, content (verbatim), visual element, text labels
3. Data points (all statistics/quotes copied exactly)
4. Design instructions from user

**Rules**: Markdown only. No new information. Preserve data faithfully. Strip any credentials or secrets from output.

See `references/structured-content-template.md` for detailed format.

### Step 3: Recommend Combinations

**3.1 Check Keyword Shortcuts first**: If user input matches a keyword from the **Keyword Shortcuts** table, auto-select the associated layout and prioritize associated styles as top recommendations. Skip content-based layout inference.

**3.2 Otherwise**, recommend 3-5 layout×style combinations based on:
- Data structure → matching layout
- Content tone → matching style
- Audience expectations
- User design instructions

### Step 4: Confirm Options

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options with the user. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first:

**Q1 — Combination**: Present 3+ layout×style combos with rationale. Ask user to pick one.

**Q2 — Aspect**: Ask for aspect ratio preference (landscape/portrait/square or custom W:H).

**Q3 — Language** (only if source ≠ user language): Ask which language the text content should use.

### Step 5: Generate Prompt → `prompts/infographic.md`

**Backup rule**: If `prompts/infographic.md` exists, rename to `prompts/infographic-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

**Load references**: Read the selected layout from `references/layouts/<layout>.md` and style from `references/styles/<style>.md`.

Combine:
1. Layout definition from `references/layouts/<layout>.md`
2. Style definition from `references/styles/<style>.md`
3. Base template from `references/base-prompt.md`
4. Structured content from Step 2
5. All text in confirmed language

**Aspect ratio resolution** for `{{ASPECT_RATIO}}`:
- Named presets → ratio string: landscape→`16:9`, portrait→`9:16`, square→`1:1`
- Custom W:H ratios → use as-is (e.g., `3:4`, `4:3`, `2.35:1`)

Save the assembled prompt to `prompts/infographic.md` using `write_file`.

### Step 6: Render

**Check tool availability first**: Look at the available Hermes tools. If `image_generate` is present, use the AI image path. If not, use the HTML/CSS fallback. Do NOT attempt `image_generate` and fail before falling back — pre-check and pick the path immediately.

#### Path A: AI Image Generation (image_generate available)

Use the `image_generate` tool with the assembled prompt from Step 5.

- Map aspect ratio to image_generate's format: `16:9` → `landscape`, `9:16` → `portrait`, `1:1` → `square`
- For custom ratios, pick the closest named aspect
- On failure, auto-retry once
- Download the returned URL to `infographic/{topic-slug}/infographic-{slug}.png` using `curl -fsSL` with an **absolute path**
- Verify the file exists and is non-empty

#### Path B: HTML/CSS Fallback (no image_generate)

When `image_generate` is not available in the current session, render a hand-crafted HTML/CSS file that structurally reproduces the baoyu layout × style:

1. **Keep the same workflow** — Steps 1-5 (analysis, structured content, prompt assembly) are still completed normally. The prompt file at `prompts/infographic.md` is the source of truth.
2. **Render as HTML** using inline CSS. Output filename: `infographic/{topic-slug}/infographic-{slug}.html`
3. **Translation rules** for each component:
   - **Layout structure** → CSS flexbox/grid that mirrors the baoyu layout definition (e.g., `binary-comparison` = two-column side-by-side with a vertical divider)
   - **Style aesthetics** → CSS colors, fonts, decorative elements matching the selected baoyu style definition (e.g., `corporate-memphis` = flat vector, geometric accents, clean sans-serif, bright saturated fills)
   - **Content hierarchy** → section headers, badge-style labels for key points, highlighted number callouts for statistics
   - **Color palette** → extract primary + accent colors from the style's reference doc and apply as CSS custom properties in a `<style>` block
   - **Data points** → stat cards or highlighted blobs at the bottom for key numbers
4. **Save** the HTML file using `write_file` to the output directory.
5. **Report** the output path and suggest opening in a browser (e.g., `open /abs/path/infographic-{slug}.html` on macOS)

### Step 7: Output Summary

Report: topic, layout, style, aspect, language, rendering path (AI image or HTML fallback), output path, and list of all files created.

## Pitfalls

1. **Data integrity is paramount** — never summarize, paraphrase, or alter source statistics. "73% increase" must stay "73% increase", not "significant increase".
2. **Strip secrets** — always scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before including in any output file.
3. **One message per section** — each infographic section should convey one clear concept. Overloading sections reduces readability.
4. **Style consistency** — the style definition from the references file must be applied consistently across the entire infographic. Don't mix styles.
5. **image_generate aspect ratios** — the tool only supports `landscape`, `portrait`, and `square`. Custom ratios like `3:4` should map to the nearest option (portrait in that case).
6. **HTML fallback: pre-check, don't retry** — check tool availability at the START of Step 6, not after a failed `image_generate` call. The HTML fallback should be the first choice when the tool is absent, not an afterthought when the tool errors out.
7. **HTML fallback: absolute paths for write_file** — always use an absolute path when saving the HTML file. The CWD can drift across tool calls, and `write_file` resolves relative to the working directory of the Hermes process, not the terminal's CWD.
